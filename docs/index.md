## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements an **automated bottle filling and capping line** using a Siemens S7-1200 PLC. The system handles bottles through five coordinated stations: grabbing, liquid filling, cap dispensing, capping, and ejection.

**Real-world application:** Small to medium-scale beverage or pharmaceutical bottling lines where consistency and cycle time matter.

## 🎯 Problem Solved

Manual bottle filling is:
- ❌ Inconsistent (varying fill levels)
- ❌ Slow (operator-dependent)
- ❌ Prone to contamination
- ❌ Difficult to track quality

**This solution:** Fully automated sequence from bottle arrival to finished product ejection.

## ⚙️ System Components

| Station | Actuators | Sensors | Function |
|---------|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Grabber** | M2, M3, M4, M5 (4 motors) | PS4 (bottle present), PSRight, PSLeft | Secures bottle during filling |
| **Belt** | Motor 1 (FWD/REV) | LS1 (home), LS2 (end) | Moves bottle between stations |
| **Liquid Filling** | Cylinder 3, Pump 1 | LS6 (home), LS7 (end) | Lowers nozzle, fills for 5 sec |
| **Cap Dispenser** | Motor M7 | PS1, PS2 (cap detection) | Feeds exactly one cap |
| **Capping** | Cylinder 2, Motor M6 | LS3 (home), LS4 (end), PS3 (bottle arrival) | Lowers, tightens cap for 5 sec |
| **Ejection** | Cylinder 1 | LS5 (home return) | Pushes finished bottle out |

## 📊 I/O Count

| Type | Count |
|------|-------|
| Digital Inputs | 14 |
| Digital Outputs | 12 |
| **Total** | **26 I/O points** |

## 🔄 Sequence of Operations
Step 1: Bottle arrives → PS4 detects → Belt stops
Step 2: Grabber closes (M2-M5) → PSRight & PSLeft confirm
Step 3: Cylinder 3 lowers nozzle → Pump runs 5 sec → Cylinder 3 raises
Step 4: Belt runs → Bottle moves to capping station → PS3 detects → Belt stops
Step 5: M7 runs → PS1 & PS2 detect cap → M7 stops (cap hangs, bottle grabs it)
Step 6: Cylinder 2 lowers capper → M6 runs 5 sec → Cylinder 2 raises
Step 7: Belt runs to end position → LS2 detects → Belt stops
Step 8: Cylinder 1 pushes bottle out → Returns to LS5
Step 9: Cycle repeats from Step 1

## ✅ What Works (Phase 1)

- [x] Bottle detection via PS4
- [x] 4-motor grabber with dual proximity verification
- [x] Timed liquid filling (5 seconds)
- [x] Single-cap dispensing with dual-sensor confirmation
- [x] Belt positioning (home/end limits)
- [x] Timed capping (5 seconds)
- [x] Automatic ejection with home return
- [x] Emergency stop (cuts all outputs immediately)
- [x] Full cycle repeat

## 🔜 Future Improvements (Phase 2)

| Improvement | Why It Matters |
|-------------|----------------|
| Grabber closure timeout | Prevents cycle stall if bottle misaligned |
| Cap jam detection (PS1) | Prevents dry-feeding empty caps |
| Pump dry-run protection | Prevents pump damage |
| Signal tower (Green/Yellow/Red) | Visual status for operators |
| Fault logging to HMI | Easier troubleshooting |
| Production counter | Track bottles/hour |

> *"Phase 1 proved the nominal sequence works. Phase 2 adds industrial robustness."*
